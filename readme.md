##Description

This website was created with the Bootstrap framework. The website itself represents a fictional soccer association in
the Ottawa, Ontario area. In other words, the "FOSA" association mentioned in the website does not really exist. The
website was developed for the sole purpose of a college assignment.

The website is composed of the four following pages:

1. [Home](http://dube0141.github.io/bootstrap-sports-site/ "Visit the Home page")
2. [Standings](http://dube0141.github.io/bootstrap-sports-site/standings.html "Visit the Standings page")
3. [Locations](http://dube0141.github.io/bootstrap-sports-site/locations.html "Visit the Locations page")
4. [Sign Up](http://dube0141.github.io/bootstrap-sports-site/sign-up.html "Visit the Sign Up page")
